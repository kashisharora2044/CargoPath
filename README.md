# 🚚 CargoPath – Smart Cargo Routing System

CargoPath is an AI-powered logistics and route optimization platform that helps transporters choose the safest and most profitable routes for fragile and high-value cargo. The application considers road damage, cargo fragility, transportation costs, and estimated profits to recommend optimal delivery paths.

## 🧠 Route Optimization Process

1. Select cargo type.
2. Choose source and destination.
3. CargoPath analyzes:
   - Road roughness
   - Cargo fragility
   - Transportation distance
   - Fuel and transportation cost
   - Expected profit
4. The safest and most profitable route is recommended.
5. Google Gemini generates a human-readable explanation for the chosen route.
